It was discovered in 1907 by Otto Hahn as a decay product of thorium (produced by decay of thorium-232). Mesothorium-1 (radium-228) in turn produces actinium-228 (mesothorium-2) as the first product of its radioactive decay, and the actinium-228 in turn decays quickly (half-life of 6 hours) to thorium-228 (which is also called radiothorium; the thorium-228 has a half-life of 1.91 years, shorter than that of the radium-228). It was discovered and named before full recognition of the nature of isotopes of the elements, and was distinguished from other variants of radium by its half-life and mode of production and decay. It was also cheaper to prepare than other short-lived radium isotopes, and was thus sold commercially, for use, e.g. in making watch dials readable in the dark by painting the hands and hour marks with a self-luminous paint containing the radioactive substance; it is therefore often referred to (e.g. in regulatory legislation) as though distinct from radium. It was one of the isotopes believed responsible for radiation-induced diseases observed in industrial workers who painted radium on watch dials in the late 1950's and early 1960's. The primary isotope of radium (radium-226) has a half-life of 1620 years, and these isotopes with shorter half-lives proved difficult to isolate and study for the purpose of finding the cause of such diseases."]]],"a":["mesothoriums"],"c":["chem"],"p":[[],[]],"f":0},"_otrochal":{"e":[["adje",["Having the middle of the body surrounded by bands of cilia; -- said of the larvae of certain marine annelids."]]],"a":[],"c":["zool"],"p":[[]],"f":0},"_otype":{"e":[["noun",["An old term covering natrolite or soda mesolite, scolecite or lime mesotype, and mesolite or lime-soda mesotype."]]],"a":["mesotypes"],"c":["min"],"p":[[],[]],"f":1},"_ovarium":{"e":[["noun",["The fold of peritoneum connecting the ovary with the wall of the abdominal cavity."]]],"a":["mesovariums"],"c":["anat"],"p":[[],[]],"f":1},"_oxalate":{"e":[["noun",["A salt of mesoxalic acid."]]],"a":["mesoxalates"],"c":["chem"],"p":[[],[]],"f":0},"_oxalic":{"e":[["adje",["Pertaining to, or designating, an acid, CH2O2(CO2H)2, obtained from amido malonic acid."]]],"a":[],"c":["chem"],"p":[[]],"f":2},"_ozoa":{"e":[["noun",["A group of very lowly organized, wormlike parasites, including the Dicyemata.
