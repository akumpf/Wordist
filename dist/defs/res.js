In Great Britain the ultimate real reserve is the gold kept on hand in the Bank of England, largely represented by the notes in hand in its own banking department; and any balance which a bank has with the Bank of England is a part of its reserve. In the United States the reserve of a national bank consists of the amount of lawful money it holds on hand against deposits, which is required by law (in 1913) to be not less than 15 per cent (U. S. Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192), three fifths of which the banks not in a reserve city (which see) may keep deposited as balances in national banks that are in reserve cities (U. S. Rev.

The reserve is always reckoned as a liability, and is calculated on net premiums. It is theoretically the difference between the present value of the total insurance and the present value of the future premiums on the insurance. The reserve, being an amount for which another company could, theoretically, afford to take over the insurance, is sometimes called the reinsurance fund or the self-insurance fund. For the first year upon any policy the net premium is called the initial reserve, and the balance left at the end of the year including interest is the terminal reserve. For subsequent years the initial reserve is the net premium, if any, plus the terminal reserve of the previous year. The portion of the reserve to be absorbed from the initial reserve in any year in payment of losses is sometimes called the insurance reserve, and the terminal reserve is then called the investment reserve.","In exhibitions, a distinction which indicates that the recipient will get a prize if another should be disqualified.","A resist.","A preparation used on an object being electroplated to fix the limits of the deposit."]]],"a":["reserved","reserving","reserves"],"c":["mil","banking","finance","calico_printing"],"f":108,"p":[["r-ih0-z-er1-v","r-iy0-z-er1-v"],["r-ih0-z-er1-v-d","r-iy0-z-er1-v-d"],["r-ih0-z-er1-v-ih0-ng","r-iy0-z-er1-v-ih0-ng"],["r-ih0-z-er1-v-z","r-iy0-z-er1-v-z"]]},"_erve_city":{"e":[["unkn",["In the national banking system of the United States, any of certain cities in which the national banks are required (U.
