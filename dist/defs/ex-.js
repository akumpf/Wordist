Hence, in composition, it signifies out of as, in exhale, exclude; off from, or out, as in exscind; beyond, as, in excess, exceed, excel; and sometimes has a privative sense of without, as in exalbuminous, exsanguinous. In some words, it intensifies the meaning; in others, it has little affect on the signification. It becomes ef- before f, as in effuse. The form e- occurs instead of ex- before b d g l m n r, and v, as in ebullient, emanate, enormous, etc. In words from the French it often appears as es-, sometimes as s- or e-; as, escape, scape, elite. Ex-, prefixed to names implying office, station, condition, denotes that the person formerly held the office, or is out of the office or condition now; as, ex-president, ex-governor, ex-mayor, ex-convict.
