It is said to have consisted originally of ten months, Martius Aprilis Maius Junius Quintilis Sextilis, September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304 days. Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year, and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan. 13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides, and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February."]]],"a":[],"c":[],"f":3,"p":[["r-ow1-m-ah0-n-k-ae1-l-ah0-n-d-er0"]]},"_ance":{"e":[["noun",["A species of fictitious writing, originally composed in meter in the Romance dialects, and afterward in prose, such as the tales of the court of Arthur, and of Amadis of Gaul; hence, any fictitious and wonderful tale; a sort of novel, especially one which treats of surprising adventures usually befalling a hero or a heroine; a tale of extravagant adventures, of love, and the like.","An adventure, or series of extraordinary events, resembling those narrated in romances; as, his courtship, or his life, was a romance .","A dreamy, imaginative habit of mind; a disposition to ignore what is real; as, a girl full of romance .","The languages, or rather the several dialects, which were originally forms of popular or vulgar Latin, and have now developed into Italian.
