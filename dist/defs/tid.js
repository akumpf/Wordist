The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former), acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.","A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood.","Tendency or direction of causes, influences, or events; course; current.","The period of twelve hours."]],["verb",["To cause to float with the tide; to drive or carry with the tide or stream.","To pour a tide or flood.","To work into or out of a river or harbor by drifting with the tide and anchoring when it becomes adverse."]]],"a":["tides","tided","tiding"],"c":["mining","naut"],"f":60,"p":[["t-ay1-d"],["t-ay1-d-z"],[],["t-ay1-d-ih0-ng"]]},"_ed":{"e":[["adje",["Affected by the tide; having a tide."]]],"a":[],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[]]},"_eland":{"e":[["noun",["Land that is overflowed by tide water; hence, land near the sea."]]],"a":["tidelands"],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_eless":{"e":[["adje",["Having no tide."]]],"a":[],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[]]},"_emark":{"e":[["noun",["a mark on a shore line indicating the normal level of the water at high tide, caused by the action of the flowing water; sometimes also used for the mark left at the point of the normal low tide; -- called also high water mark.","the maximum level which some activity has reached and from which it has declined; -- called also high water mark."]]],"a":["tidemarks"],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_e-rode":{"e":[["adje",["Swung by the tide when at anchor; -- opposed to wind-rode."]]],"a":[],"c":["naut"],"f":0,"p":[["t-ay1-d-r-ow1-d"]]},"_esman":{"e":[["noun",["A customhouse officer who goes on board of a merchant ship to secure payment of the duties; a tidewaiter."]]],"a":["tidesmen"],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_ewaiter":{"e":[["noun",["A customhouse officer who watches the landing of goods from merchant vessels, in order to secure payment of duties."]]],"a":["tidewaiters"],"c":[],"f":1,"p":[[],[]]},"_eway":{"e":[["noun",["Channel in which the tide sets."]]],"a":["tideways"],"c":[],"f":1,"p":[[],[]]},"_ife":{"e":[["noun",["The blue titmouse."]]],"a":["tidifes"],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_ily":{"e":[["adve",["In a tidy manner."]]],"a":[],"c":[],"f":1,"p":[[]]},"_iness":{"e":[["noun",["The quality or state of being tidy."]]],"a":["tidinesses","untidiness"],"c":[],"f":2,"p":[[],[],[]]},"_ings":{"e":[["noun",["Account of what has taken place, and was not before known; news."]]],"a":["tidingses"],"c":[],"f":14,"p":[["t-ay1-d-ih0-ng-z"],[]]},"_ley":{"e":[["noun",["The wren.","The goldcrest."]]],"a":["tidleys"],"c":["zool"],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_ology":{"e":[["noun",["A discourse or treatise upon the tides; that part of science which treats of tides."]]],"a":["tidologies"],"c":[],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_y":{"e":[["noun",["The wren; -- called also tiddy.","A cover, often of tatting, drawn work, or other ornamental work, for the back of a chair, the arms of a sofa, or the like.","A child's pinafore."]],["adje",["Arranged in good order; orderly; appropriate; neat; kept in proper and becoming neatness, or habitually keeping things so; as, a tidy lass; their dress is tidy; the apartments are well furnished and tidy ."]],["verb",["To put in proper order; to make neat; as, to tidy a room; to tidy one's dress.","To make things tidy."]]],"a":["tidies","tidied","tidying"],"c":["zool"],"f":10,"p":[["t-ay1-d-iy0"],[],[],[]]},"_ytips":{"e":[["noun",["A California composite plant (Layia platyglossa), the flower of which has yellow rays tipped with white."]]],"a":["tidytipses"],"c":["bot"],"f":0,"p":[[],[]]},"_al_waves":"_tidal_wave","_bits":"_tidbit","_dy":"_tidde","_dered":"_tidder","_dering":"_tidder","_ders":"_tidder","_dledywinkses":"_tiddledywinks","_dlywinkses":"_tiddlywinks","_es":"_tide","_ing":"_tide","_elands":"_tideland","_emarks":"_tidemark","_esmen":"_tidesman","_ewaiters":"_tidewaiter","_eways":"_tideway","_ifes":"_tidife","_inesses":"_tidiness","_ingses":"_tidings","_leys":"_tidley","_ologies":"_tidology","_ies":"_tidy","_ied":"_tidy","_ying":"_tidy","_ytipses":"_tidytips"};
