When Argus was killed by Hermes at the command of Zeus, the heifer was maddened by a terrible gadfly sent by Hera, and wandered about until she arrived in Egypt. There she recovered her original shape, and bore Epaphus to Zeus. Epaphus became the ancestor of AEgyptus, Damaus, Cepheus, and Phineus. She was identified by the Egyptians with Isis. According to another legend, Io was carried off by Phoenician traders who landed in Argos. The myth is generally explained to be Aah or the moon wandering in the starry skies, symbolized by the hundred-eyed Argus; her transformation into a horned heifer representing the crescent moon."]]],"a":["ios"],"c":[],"p":[["ay1-ow0"],["iy1-ow0-s","ay1-ow0-s"]],"f":3}};
