Wordist
=============

Wordist is an open source dictionary with incremental search is hosted entirely on a static web server.

Try out wordist here: http://akumpf.github.io/wordist/

There's no backend logic doing anything fancy; it's just a big folder full of little javascipt snippets with corresponding definitions, parts of speech, etc. so you can experiment with language without 3rd-party APIs.

The entire dataset is a bit hefty to access directly (> 20MB), but breaking it up into 3000+ little pages of words and definitions keeps it light-weight and speedy for the web. Big thanks to the GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English for the data that makes Wordist possible.
